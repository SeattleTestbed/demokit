The Seattle Demokit
=======

 The demokit packages up a set of tools for Seattle users and developers that allow you to

* Access VMs on remote machines, for example such assigned to you by the  Seattle Clearinghouse
* Run RepyV2 code on your local machine, using a supplied restrictions file, and thusly
* Develop and debug Repy programs locally. 

See [the Seattle wiki](https://seattle.poly.edu/wiki/BuildDemokit) for build instructions.
